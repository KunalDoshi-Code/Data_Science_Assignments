Regular use may run upto 3-4 days. Casual use may run weeks. The only thing is it's little heavy and you may wish to switch to earbuds, but they have low runtime.Else is good, but I feel you may get more sharp sound in pTron earbuds at cheaper rate if u are short on money. Else go for boat one as it will be more safer to ears.\\n\",\n  \"\\nI'm a JBL fan. Compared to JBL (and other high end brands) the quality is not upto mark. But at this price it is delivering what is expected at this cost.Battery charging and backup : 5/5Bass: 4/5Treble: 2/5\\n\",\n  '\\nOnly one thing need to improve is to increase rigidness of neck band so that one can use only one bud while riding. Currently due to wind flow probability of loss.\\n',\n  '\\n1.Cable quality is moderate.2.Hearing butts its not fit in earings3.magnet power is low4.noise control moderate\\n',\n  '\\nI have been using same model from last one and half year, the performance was too good, suddenly it was not working hence ordered same model Bluetooth earphones again.\\n',\n  '\\nThe product is good but the earphone is not fitting in ear.

Audio and Mic quality is good as expected. The major highlight of this neckband is its battery.  Its battery life has really astonished me. I use it for around 3 hours in a day and it easily lasts 10 to 12 days easily on a single full charge(May vary depending upon the volume at which it is used, I usually use it at around 30%). Plus it charges very rapidly. Takes less than an hour to charge.The only problem I face is that sometimes when I try to connect it to my laptop, it shows that device is connected but the neckband keeps repeating 'Your device is ready to pair' every 2 seconds as if it is in pairing mode even though it is paired. . Similarly when connecting with my phone, it sometimes doesn't connect and the phone shows 'Problem connecting with device'. In both the cases, restarting the neckband fixes the problem.However these two cases are quite rare (once in a hundred). So it is not a major issue for me.Overall it's a great product from BoAt.\\n\",\n  '\\nMust buy if your budget 1000 - 1500₹ 🙂\\n',\n  '\\nI love that product i am using for months there is no sort of issue i also recommend to everyone u can buy this product blindly\\n',\n  '\\nMindblowing purchased\\n',\n  '',\n  '\\nDelivery is to let But product is Nice\\n',\n  '\\nAuto on/off Kam nhi karta hai call aane par कम्पन nhi karta hai call auto रिसीव हो जाता है जिसके वजह से बहुत दिक्कत हो रहा है\\n',\n  '\\nVery good sound\\n',\n  '\\nVery nice product\\n',\n  '\\nGood\\n',\n  '\\nIt is a good product but only issue is while you are using the same there is auto false notification (voice) that the device is switching on and switching off. There must be some software error.\\n',\n  '\\nBass Kam hai quality achhi hai price Jada hai\\n',\n  '\\nPros: 1) Audio quality is great. Perfect combination of bass and treble and also the clarity is very good.2) Awesome battery. Charges very fast and last longer. No issue with battery backup.3) Calling and noise cancellation is good.Cons: 1) The wire quality looks very cheap especially considering the price. Boat should invest on durability as well and not only on sound. Because no one wants to go to service center.2) The magnet or probably the design is not well thats why the earphones moves away when took out from ears and stick together with magnet.\\n',\n  '\\nLong battery life clear sound quality my sister charge 3-4 days once\\n',\n  '',\n  '\\nHa\\n',\n  '\\nGood product\\n',\n  '',\n  '\\ngood\\n',\n  '\\nOverall product was worth for price.\\n',\n  '\\nIt does not fit my ear properly and it gets disconnected again and again, otherwise it is very good.

Holds 4-5DBass not best like some other hdphones.. but good only. Sound also good..If ear hook is lost, then bud won't hold that tight in ear, i faced that problem.Distance coverage is good, unless there is 2 walls inbetween.Most reviewers won't say, there is an issue.While u r on WhatsApp call, then normal call comes... Your voice gets disconnected from that call and opposite person can't hear you until ringing ends.\\n\",\n  '\\nCompany should improve noise cancellation quality more... Other things are good.\\n',\n  '\\nBattery life is excellentYou connect with your 2 mobiles at a timeOr you can connect to your 1 android supported TV and you can enjoy personally with out disturbing other.Suggested for only calling .Music lovers will not get satisfaction because of low Bass and Tribble sound.\\n',\n  '\\nThe product quality is good. Particularly sound quality is good. Linking with my mobile had been pretty simple and quick. My usage is less and I use it only when I walk. So really cannot comment on battery backup. But for me it came for almost 1 week once I fully charged as I hardly use it for 2 hours per day.The only not so interesting part of this is that, when we walk fast, somehow slowly the earpods come out of ear because of weight of the wire and the mouthpiece. I am not sure if all the bluetooth ear phones will be like that, but this is my observation with this one.\\n',\n  '\\nBoat ka ye product Maine 3 Days use Kiya or is product ki built quality bhuat acchi hai. Music so good and Base is too Goood. 3 days use kerne per bhi bettry backup accha hai or ye product is price PE sabse accha hai.

Feels soft even on loud scale. Can't say about the wire quality. If lasts for 2 years then value for money.\\n\",\n  '\\nWriting this review after 10 months of usage. First about the product itself.  It\\'s sound quality is very good. Bass lovers will just love it. Average mids and high.  It lasts about 25-28 hrs with a full charge. Also tested on heavy rain while driving ( don\\'t worry , earphones were not plugged in.. 😂). It was on my neck. But there was no water ingress.Now the major problem kicks in . After 10 months left speaker was not working. So , I registered a complaint on boat website. They picked my earphone for replacement.  But later it was replaced with \" rockerz 255 pro \" instead of \" rockerz 255 pro + \" . Why ? Even after a lot of conversations with boat support they didn\\'t provide me my model . Now I\\'ve to stick with these low quality ear peace. Hence ,Try to avoid boat online support for warranty claim and better visit physical service entre. Good luck.Edit : After having conversation with higher authorities on Twitter, they replaced the same with my model .Edit 2 : from first day onwards after receiving the replacement product I was in doubt that the sound quality was decreased a lot. So, again I replaced with the authorized service centre for flat ( no/ very low bass)  sound.  But the 2nd replacement is also same. I thought I\\'ve some issues with my ear lol 😆 . But today when I listened to my friends rockerz 255 pro + (same as mine but the retail unit) I was surprised and thankful too . My ear was not damaged . It had the same punchy bass and that signature sound which was absent from my replacement unit.So, I can conclude by saying the replacement product will not have that signature sound as the retail unit.If anybody has experienced the same please comment.Thanks\\n',\n  '\\nProduct is very good\\n',\n  '\\nGood quality\\n',\n  '\\nBattery backup is very good👍Sound quality is very good👍\\n',\n  '\\nBest neckband in this price range\\n',\n  '\\nThe wait of chargeable side is quite high.It is dropping frequently from ear.It should be taken care.\\n',\n  '\\nthis is not fit in my ear. so please can check and again replace my product.

The sound quality is made to play sound, that's it. I don't feel if the bass is even there or not. There's also a very unnoticeable hiss playing along with the audio you're playing, it's mostly unnoticed but I hate it. Buying a TWS earbud is way way better.
