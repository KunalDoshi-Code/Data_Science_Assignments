Ashutosh Yadav ,"It has good runtime. Regular use may run upto 3-4 days. Casual use may run weeks. The only thing is it's little heavy and you may wish to switch to earbuds, but they have low runtime.Else is good, but I feel you may get more sharp sound in pTron earbuds at cheaper rate if u are short on money. Else go for boat one as it will be more safer to ears."
PIYUSH,I'm a JBL fan. Compared to JBL (and other high end brands) the quality is not upto mark. But at this price it is delivering what is expected at this cost.Battery charging and backup : 5/5Bass: 4/5Treble: 2/5
Ashutosh Yadav ,1.Cable quality is moderate.2.Hearing butts its not fit in earings3.magnet power is low4.noise control moderate
Ashutosh Yadav ,"I have been using same model from last one and half year, the performance was too good, suddenly it was not working hence ordered same model Bluetooth earphones again."
Deepak,The product is good but the earphone is not fitting in ear. It is falling down.

Tejal k.,"My ears started to hurt after a hour, but overall sound quality is good."
Dinesh Kumar,Overall okay
Not great . You will get a better one in local shops ,
Molla Mazharul Islam,"Been using it for 2 months now. Audio and Mic quality is good as expected. The major highlight of this neckband is its battery.  Its battery life has really astonished me. I use it for around 3 hours in a day and it easily lasts 10 to 12 days easily on a single full charge(May vary depending upon the volume at which it is used, I usually use it at around 30%). Plus it charges very rapidly. Takes less than an hour to charge.The only problem I face is that sometimes when I try to connect it to my laptop, it shows that device is connected but the neckband keeps repeating 'Your device is ready to pair' every 2 seconds as if it is in pairing mode even though it is paired. . Similarly when connecting with my phone, it sometimes doesn't connect and the phone shows 'Problem connecting with device'. In both the cases, restarting the neckband fixes the problem.However these two cases are quite rare (once in a hundred). So it is not a major issue for me.Overall it's a great product from BoAt."

Raj Gupta,Very nice product
Faisal Fazeel,Good
Faisal Fazeel,It is a good product but only issue is while you are using the same there is auto false notification (voice) that the device is switching on and switching off. There must be some software error.
Ashish s.,Bass Kam hai quality achhi hai price Jada hai
ujjwal sharma,"The product quality is good. Particularly sound quality is good. Linking with my mobile had been pretty simple and quick. My usage is less and I use it only when I walk. So really cannot comment on battery backup. But for me it came for almost 1 week once I fully charged as I hardly use it for 2 hours per day.The only not so interesting part of this is that, when we walk fast, somehow slowly the earpods come out of ear because of weight of the wire and the mouthpiece. I am not sure if all the bluetooth ear phones will be like that, but this is my observation with this one."
Naushad Ansari,Pros: 1) Audio quality is great. Perfect combination of bass and treble and also the clarity is very good.2) Awesome battery. Charges very fast and last longer. No issue with battery backup.3) Calling and noise cancellation is good.Cons: 1) The wire quality looks very cheap especially considering the price. Boat should invest on durability as well and not only on sound. Because no one wants to go to service center.2) The magnet or probably the design is not well thats why the earphones moves away when took out from ears and stick together with magnet.
SIRIPIREDDY GIRIDHAR REDDY,Long battery life clear sound quality my sister charge 3-4 days once

Palash,"We can connect desktop & Mobile at same time ,Its amazing product but if go to listen old songs Right ear bud is not earing..."
GOPAL,"The battery life is 3 days under moderate to heavy usage, which is extremely nice to have. Come with a USB-C charging cable. So it charges up to 100% in an hour only."
Appu,Fantastic
surendra kumar sah,"Review after 4 monthsGood battery back up.. Holds 4-5DBass not best like some other hdphones.. but good only. Sound also good..If ear hook is lost, then bud won't hold that tight in ear, i faced that problem.Distance coverage is good, unless there is 2 walls inbetween.Most reviewers won't say, there is an issue.While u r on WhatsApp call, then normal call comes... Your voice gets disconnected from that call and opposite person can't hear you until ringing ends."
Satyabrata M R Samal,Company should improve noise cancellation quality more... Other things are good.
Adarsh,Battery life is excellentYou connect with your 2 mobiles at a timeOr you can connect to your 1 android supported TV and you can enjoy personally with out disturbing other.Suggested for only calling .Music lovers will not get satisfaction because of low Bass and Tribble sound.
Adarsh,Boat ka ye product Maine 3 Days use Kiya or is product ki built quality bhuat acchi hai. Music so good and Base is too Goood. 3 days use kerne per bhi bettry backup accha hai or ye product is price PE sabse accha hai. My favorite brand Boat
Babita chakawarti,"I gave it a 4 because your ears start to hurt if you use thhem for long time,about the sound quality its quite good according to the price it works fine and getts instantly connected to devices, Btw u can connect more than one device at a time"
Ashutosh Yadav ,I like boat products and more playtime for less recharging time all.I bought this product for ear hooks. But that's easily getting missed from earbuds. Either they should give fixed ear hooks or provide extra earhooks like buds. Even separate earhooks not available in market. ‚õµ Should consider it

The neckband stopped working completely in 3 weeks. Post replacement got the correct productProduct is good but DO NOT PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM THIS SUPPLIER
PIYUSH,"I used to use wire headphones, and transitioning to Bluetooth headphones was very easy. I use them while working out and they work fine. it is sweat resistant. For all the headphones before this one I had to go to the service centre, I didn't go even once to the service centre for this one. amazing quality"
indrani ghoshal,Nice sound quality super
indrani ghoshal,If you run or move a lot go for a model with stronger magnets(oneplus bulletz) as the magnets barely works.
jignesh,"I am using the small ear tips just because they are the only ones that won't hurt my ears, using the mediums can be more secure but they hurt my ears over long periods. The sound quality is made to play sound, that's it. I don't feel if the bass is even there or not. There's also a very unnoticeable hiss playing along with the audio you're playing, it's mostly unnoticed but I hate it. Buying a TWS earbud is way way better. Boat just isn't the best audio company anymore according to me."
GUDDU KUMAR,Nice product
Ramesh Kr.Mahto,Lovely and nice quality earbuds
Mohammad meraj,How to reset my headphone.bcoz it gets disconnected while listening and calling.
Mohammad meraj,"This Bluetooth earphone provides a good quality sound and a good battery backup. I can use this for more than a week after a full charge.The only problem I have faced with this one that, the tilted rubber grip for supporting the ear often comes out. Another thing is, if the microphone is nearer to the mouth than the actual position, it will be better.However, I'm satisfied with this one."
Syed Subhanuddin,Its sound quality is the best .Bass quality is also goodValue of money
Amit Kumar Singh,Bluetooth connectivity same problem only is there
Deepak s. Gariya,"Good headphones, sound quality is also good, but magnet is not good at all, not properly stick headphones to each other... & That is part of concern..."
